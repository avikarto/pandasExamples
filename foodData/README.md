# foodData
[Data Science] Analysis of a poorly-organized JSON database containing USDA nutrition information for over 6600 different food items.

This project seeks to import and munge a large JSON database into a useable dataframe object.  Tthe following project goals are addressed:

1) Import a very large JSON database and extract important information into a readable dataframe.
2) As a simple analysis example, calculate the protein/kcal ratio of all foods and find the top five.

This database was constructed by Ashley Williams, but appears to no longer be hosted by them directly (http://ashleyw.co.uk/project/food-nutrient-database redirects to a dead Linkedin page).  A copy of this database is stil hosted by Wes McKinney, the author of "Python for Data Analysis" (https://github.com/wesm/pydata-book/blob/2nd-edition/datasets/usda_food/database.json).
