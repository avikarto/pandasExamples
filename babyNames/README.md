[Data Science] Analysis of national baby names from 1880-2017

Using birth data from the Social Security Administration, this project seeks to investigate some choice trends in baby naming and birth rates over the past ~140 years.  The data files contained herein are sourced from: https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html

The following questions were used as a starting point for this analysis, and were examined both in terms of tabulated data and graphical representations of said data:

1) How have total birth rates by sex varied over this time period?
2) How common has my name been historically?
      - During this investigation, I discovered that Andrew has also been a female name.  This was studied as well.
3) How has the average length of names changed over the years in question?
4) How many unique names have babies had each year?
5) What has been the most popular name for males and females each year, and how often was each most-popular name the most popular?
